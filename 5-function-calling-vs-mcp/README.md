# MCP Crash Course for Python Developers: Part 4

## Comparing MCP to Traditional Function Calling

This section compares using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a traditional function-calling approach (e.g., as shown in a hypothetical `function-calling.py`).

### MCP vs. Traditional: Key Differences

Here’s how MCP compares to a traditional setup, like directly calling functions in a Python script:

- **MCP Approach** (e.g., `server.py` and `client.py` from `3-simple-server-setup`):
  - Uses a standardized server-client setup (e.g., `get_knowledge_base` tool accessing `data/kb.json`).
  - Tools are exposed via MCP, allowing OpenAI or other clients to call them.
  - Supports stdio or SSE for communication, enabling local or remote operation.
  - Example from OpenAI integration:
    ```python
    # server.py
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
    import json

    mcp = FastMCP("KnowledgeBaseServer")
    @mcp.tool()
    def get_knowledge_base(query: str) -> str:
        with open("data/kb.json", "r") as f:
            kb = json.load(f)
        return kb.get(query, "No answer found.")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp.run()
    ```

- **Traditional Approach** (e.g., `function-calling.py`):
  - Directly defines functions in the script and calls them without a server.
  - No standardization; functions are specific to the application.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # function-calling.py
    import json
    def get_knowledge_base(query: str) -> str:
        with open("data/kb.json", "r") as f:
            kb = json.load(f)
        return kb.get(query, "No answer found.")

    print(get_knowledge_base("What’s the vacation policy?"))
    ```

**Key Differences**:
- **Small Scale**: Traditional function calling is simpler for single, self-contained apps (e.g., no server setup needed).
- **Larger Scale**: MCP organizes multiple tools better, as each tool is defined in a server and accessible to various clients.
- **Reuse**: MCP servers (e.g., `server.py`) can be used by multiple apps or AI models, unlike traditional functions tied to one script.
- **Remote Access**: MCP supports distributed systems with SSE transport, while traditional approaches are typically local.

### When to Choose MCP

Use **MCP** when:
- You want tools shared across multiple apps or AI models (e.g., OpenAI and other clients using `get_knowledge_base`).
- Your system is distributed, with servers and clients on different machines (e.g., using SSE on port 3001).
- You can use existing MCP servers from the community (see [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)).
- Standardization benefits users, like offering consistent tool access in a product.

Use **Traditional Function Calling** when:
- Your app is simple and doesn’t need external tool sharing.
- Performance is critical (direct function calls are faster than MCP’s server-client communication).
- You’re prototyping and need quick changes without server setup.

## Integration with Your Setup

In your `3-simple-server-setup` directory (`client-sse.py`, `client-stdio.py`, `README.md`, `server.py`):
- **MCP Example**: Use `server.py` and `client.py` from the OpenAI integration (Part 5) to run the `get_knowledge_base` tool with `data/kb.json`. This leverages MCP’s standardization for OpenAI.
  ```bash
  python client.py
  ```
- **Traditional Example**: Create a `function-calling.py` for comparison:
  ```python
  import json
  def get_knowledge_base(query: str) -> str:
      with open("data/kb.json", "r") as f:
          kb = json.load(f)
      return kb.get(query, "No answer found.")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      print(get_knowledge_base("What’s the vacation policy?"))
  ```
  Run:
  ```bash
  python function-calling.py
  ```
  This is simpler but lacks MCP’s flexibility for multiple clients or remote access.

## Troubleshooting
- **Previous Errors**: Your earlier issues (`ECONNREFUSED` on port 3001, `No such file: run`) were due to running `mcp dev server.py` with an incorrect SSE setup and attempting a non-existent `run` script. For MCP, use `python client.py` (stdio) or configure `server.py` for SSE:
  ```python
  mcp = FastMCP("KnowledgeBaseServer", host="127.0.0.1", port=3001)
  mcp.run(transport="sse")
  ```
  Then run:
  ```bash
  python server.py
  mcp dev server.py
  ```
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `mcp` and `openai` are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install mcp openai python-dotenv
  ```
