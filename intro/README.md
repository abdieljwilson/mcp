# MCP Crash Course for Python Developers

## Introduction to MCP

### Understanding MCP: Hype vs. Reality

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is getting a lot of attention in the AI world. It’s a standard way for large language models (LLMs) to connect with tools like APIs or databases. But let’s clear up the hype: MCP isn’t a brand-new technology—it’s a new standard for something developers already do, which is letting LLMs use tools through function calls.

You might have seen demos of MCP working with personal AI assistants like Claude Desktop. That’s cool, but this guide focuses on something else: how Python developers can use MCP to build and integrate custom servers into real-world applications.

### Personal vs. App Integration

There are two main ways to use MCP:

1. **Personal Use**: Connecting MCP to AI assistants like Claude Desktop or Cursor to boost your personal workflow.
2. **App Integration**: Adding MCP to Python applications for production systems, like automated tools or smart apps.

Most online guides focus on personal use, but this crash course is for developers who want to integrate MCP into their Python apps for robust, scalable systems.

### What You’ll Learn

This crash course is designed for Python developers who want to:
- Understand how MCP works technically.
- Build custom MCP servers using the Python SDK.
- Add MCP servers to their Python applications.
- Decide when and how to use MCP effectively.
